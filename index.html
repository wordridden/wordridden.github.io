            <p>Hello, my name is Jessica Spengler. I’m a German to English translator with a passion for language and a commitment to producing polished translations that meet the needs of the author and audience alike.</p>

            <p>I realize that choosing a translator can be a tricky business. You probably have concerns about quality, accuracy, and cultural sensitivity, not to mention costs—and you’re probably pressed for time. I understand how hard it can be to entrust your text to a translator you don’t know, and I’d like to put your mind at ease.</p>

                <h2>I am trustworthy</h2>

                <p>Many of my clients have worked with me for a decade or more. Clients return to me because they know they can count on me to create refined texts that reflect well on them. I enjoy establishing friendly, long-lasting relationships with clients—individuals, agencies and organizations alike. Whether you have a one-off translation need or are looking for longer-term collaboration, I can help you.</p>

                <h2>I am reliable</h2>

                <p>I’m honest about how long will take to finish a translation, and I meet my deadlines. Always. From press releases that need to be turned around promptly to big projects that may take months to complete, I budget my time carefully—because I know that my time is ultimately your time. You can also expect quick response times and frequent communication from me when I’m working on your text, so you’ll always know the status of your project.</p>

                <h2>I am professional</h2>

                <p>I take pride in my work because I love what I do. Translation is both an art and a craft; it demands creativity and sensitivity as well as skilled research and nuts-and-bolts linguistic knowledge. I embrace every aspect of this work, and I take every job seriously—that means using the right terminology, finding the right register, and crafting texts that cross the cultural divide while staying true to the author’s voice.</p>
