            <p>Hello, my name is Jessica Spengler.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m a German to English translator specializing in the humanities and social sciences. I have extensive experience in non-fiction literary translation and have worked as a translator and copyeditor on numerous museum exhibitions, academic publications and other projects.</p>
                <p>Many of my clients have worked with me for a decade or more. Publishers and other organizations return to me again and again because they know they can count on me to produce accurate, refined translations that respect the source text and target audience alike. Whether you have a one-off translation need or are looking for longer-term collaboration, I'm happy to help.</p>
