            <h1>My background</h1>

            <p>I understand how to cross cultures because I’m a product of different cultures myself: I was born in America, I spent 14 years living, studying, and working in Germany, and I’ve lived in the UK since 2000. I translate exclusively into English, my native language.</p>

            <p>I have a bachelor’s degree in German studies from <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke College</a> (with honors, 1996) and a master’s degree in applied linguistics from the <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/">University of Sussex</a> (with honors, 2005). I began working as a translator and proofreader for the <a href="https://www.uni-freiburg.de/">University of Freiburg</a> in the late 1990s and have continually expanded by client base and areas of expertise since becoming a full-time freelancer in the year 2000.</p>

            <p>I’m a member of the <a href="https://www.atanet.org/">American Translators Association</a> (German Language Division and Literary Division) as well as the Translators Association of the <a href="http://www.societyofauthors.org/">Society of Authors</a> in the UK. I was also a founding member of the Brighton Language Collective, an independent group of language professionals working in Brighton, England.</p>
            
            <p>In 2019 I was invited to participate in the <a href="https://www.ghil.ac.uk/gint_translab.html">GINT TRANSLAB German-English Translation Workshop and Panel</a> at the German Historical Institute in London and the <a href="https://www.buchmesse.de/en/international-business/fellowship-and-grant-programmes/frankfurt-international-translators">Frankfurt International Translators program</a> at the Frankfurt Book Fair.</p>
